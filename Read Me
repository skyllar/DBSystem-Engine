*****************************Validation of SQL Query can Handle*****************************
	1.Data types matching(integer,varchar,float)
	2.Brackets and their nesting within where and having clause
	3.Aliasing of tables
	4.Other type of Validation of SQL statements

******************************Execution of Query***************************************
	Index is initially created for all the columns of the table
	For each query:
		Validation is checked
		Conditions are checked and corresponding line numbers are stored in set
		Records from the file are fetched only for these line numbers
		Records are obtained from LRU everytime. So Better page size and Page count will improve the performance
		
***************************Extra Features and Cases Handled*******************************

(1) Where clause can include nested brackets.
(2) Where clause can include any combination of 'And'/'OR' operators with brackets.
(3) Associativity of the operators (including brackets) has been taken careof

***********************************Phase 4 Added *************************************************

(1) Join between two relations is handled
(2) Number of distinct rows can be obtained from V(tablename,columnName)
(3) If number of tables in the inner join query is more than two, the optimised order of the execution is displayed along with the cost to execute it
(4) For optimal order, concept of Matrix chain multiplication is used with change in the cost factor
